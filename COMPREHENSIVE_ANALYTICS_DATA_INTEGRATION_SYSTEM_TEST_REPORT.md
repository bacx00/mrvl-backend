## üîß Technical Implementation Plan

### Database Architecture Improvements
```sql
-- Optimize analytics queries with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_status_date ON matches(status, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_players_rating ON players(rating DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_region_rating ON teams(region, rating DESC);

-- Add analytics-specific tables
CREATE TABLE analytics_cache (
    key VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    data JSON,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Optimization Strategy
```php
// Implement caching for analytics endpoints
Route::middleware(['cache:3600'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin/analytics', [AnalyticsController::class, 'index']);
    Route::get('/admin/stats', [AdminStatsController::class, 'index']);
});

// Add rate limiting for high-frequency requests
Route::middleware(['throttle:100,1'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/matches', [MatchController::class, 'index']);
    Route::get('/players', [PlayerController::class, 'index']);
});
```

### Frontend Enhancement Framework
```javascript
// Modern chart implementation with Chart.js
import { Chart, registerables } from 'chart.js';
Chart.register(...registerables);

// Real-time data updates
const useRealTimeAnalytics = (endpoint, refreshInterval = 30000) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(async () => {
      const response = await api.get(endpoint);
      setData(response.data);
    }, refreshInterval);
    
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [endpoint, refreshInterval]);
  
  return data;
};
```
