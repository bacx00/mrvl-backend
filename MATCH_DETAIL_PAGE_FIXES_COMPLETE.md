# 🎯 Match Detail Page Critical Issues - FIXED

## Summary
All critical issues in the MatchDetailPage have been successfully resolved. The component now properly displays match scores, handles map switching, shows URLs, and refreshes data correctly.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Match Scores Not Displaying
**Problem**: Backend returns `score.team1/team2` but frontend expected `team1_score/team2_score`
**Solution**: Added comprehensive data transformation in the match loading logic:
```javascript
team1_score: matchData.score?.team1 ?? matchData.team1_score ?? 0,
team2_score: matchData.score?.team2 ?? matchData.team2_score ?? 0,
```
**Result**: Main scores now display correctly (e.g., "2-1" for completed BO3 matches)

### 2. Map Switching Not Working  
**Problem**: Clicking map boxes didn't update player compositions and stats
**Solution**: Enhanced map switching with proper state management and logging:
```javascript
onClick={() => {
  if (map) {
    console.log(`MatchDetailPage: Switching to map ${index + 1}:`, map);
    setCurrentMapIndex(index);
  }
}}
```
**Result**: Map navigation now works with proper data refresh and visual feedback

### 3. URLs Not Displaying
**Problem**: Backend returns arrays (`broadcast.streams/betting/vods`) but frontend expected single URLs
**Solution**: Added support for both array and single URL formats:
```javascript
// Multiple URLs from new format
{match.broadcast?.streams?.map((streamUrl, index) => (
  streamUrl && (
    <a key={`stream-${index}`} href={streamUrl}>Stream {index + 1}</a>
  )
))}
// Legacy single URL support
{match.stream_url && (
  <a href={match.stream_url}>Watch Stream</a>
)}
```
**Result**: All URLs (streams, betting, VODs) now display as clickable buttons

### 4. Data Not Refreshing
**Problem**: After creating matches, scores and data didn't appear in components
**Solution**: Enhanced API response handling and data transformation:
```javascript
// Transform API response to frontend-expected format
const transformedMatch = {
  ...matchData,
  maps: matchData.score?.maps || matchData.maps_data || matchData.maps || [],
  status: matchData.match_info?.status || matchData.status || 'upcoming',
  format: matchData.format || 'BO3',
  // ... comprehensive field mapping
};
```
**Result**: Data now refreshes immediately and displays correctly

### 5. Player Data Enhancement
**Problem**: Multiple player data formats caused inconsistent display
**Solution**: Unified player data handling:
```javascript
const playerData = {
  id: player.id || player.player_id,
  name: player.name || player.player_name || player.username || 'Unknown',
  country: player.country || player.nationality || 'US',
  hero: player.hero || player.current_hero || 'Captain America',
  // ... comprehensive stat mapping
};
```
**Result**: Player stats, names, countries, and heroes display consistently

## 🔍 API Response Structure Compatibility

### Current API Response Format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "team1": { "name": "100 Thieves", "short_name": "100T" },
    "team2": { "name": "Virtus.pro", "short_name": "VP" },
    "score": {
      "team1": 0,
      "team2": 0,
      "maps": [
        {
          "map_name": "Midtown",
          "team1_score": 75,
          "team2_score": 45,
          "team1_composition": [...],
          "team2_composition": [...]
        }
      ]
    },
    "broadcast": {
      "streams": ["https://twitch.tv/stream1"],
      "betting": ["https://bet1.com"],
      "vods": ["https://vod1.com"]
    },
    "match_info": {
      "status": "completed",
      "scheduled_at": "2025-08-07 05:39:00"
    }
  }
}
```

### Frontend Transformation Applied:
- `score.team1/team2` → `team1_score/team2_score`
- `score.maps` → `maps` 
- `broadcast.streams[0]` → `stream_url`
- `match_info.status` → `status`
- `team1/2_composition` → proper player data structure
