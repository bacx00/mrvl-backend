## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES (MUST FIX BEFORE LAUNCH)

### 1. **HIGH RISK: Exposed Test Files**
- **Issue:** Multiple test files contain sensitive system information
- **Risk:** System introspection, potential data leakage
- **Files to Remove:**
  ```
  test*.php, *test*.php, auth-test-*.txt
  comprehensive-test*.php, test_*.php
  ```

### 2. **HIGH RISK: Test Routes in Production**
- **Issue:** Bypass authentication routes exposed in `/routes/api.php`
- **Risk:** Unauthorized admin access
- **Lines to Remove:** 754-783, 808-812

### 3. **MEDIUM RISK: Console Logging**
- **Issue:** 1000+ console.log statements in frontend
- **Risk:** Sensitive data exposure in browser devtools

---

## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES TO ADDRESS

### 1. Hero System
- **Issue:** 0 heroes returned from API
- **Impact:** Hero selection may not work properly
- **Priority:** Medium (if hero selection is required)

### 2. Player Profile Data
- **Issue:** Some player profiles missing IGN names
- **Impact:** Display issues in player listings
- **Priority:** Low (cosmetic)

### 3. Database Authentication
- **Issue:** Direct database connection failed (credentials)
- **Impact:** No impact on application functionality
- **Priority:** Low (application uses Laravel ORM correctly)

---

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE PRE-LAUNCH ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Critical Security Fixes (MUST DO):
```bash
# 1. Remove all test files
cd /var/www/mrvl-backend
rm -f test*.php *test*.php auth-test-*.txt test-*.log comprehensive-test*.php

# 2. Clean console.log statements
cd /var/www/mrvl-frontend/frontend
find src -type f \( -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" \) -exec sed -i '/console\./d' {} +

# 3. Comment out test routes in routes/api.php
# Lines 754-783: Test role verification routes
# Lines 808-812: Direct creation bypass routes

# 4. Clear all caches
cd /var/www/mrvl-backend
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

### Optional Improvements:
```bash
# 1. Populate hero data if needed
php artisan db:seed --class=HeroSeeder

# 2. Complete player profile data
php artisan db:seed --class=PlayerProfileSeeder

# 3. Start queue worker for background jobs
php artisan queue:work --daemon
```
