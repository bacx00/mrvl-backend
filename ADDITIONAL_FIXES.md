# ðŸ”§ ADDITIONAL ADMIN API FIXES

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEW ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED:**

### **âœ… 1. MISSING ADMIN GET ROUTES - ADDED:**

The frontend admin panel needs to fetch individual records for editing, but these routes were missing:

#### **Added Admin GET Routes:**
- âœ… **GET /api/admin/events/{id}** - For event editing (was causing 405 error)
- âœ… **GET /api/admin/teams/{id}** - For team editing
- âœ… **GET /api/admin/players/{id}** - For player editing (with team relation)
- âœ… **GET /api/admin/matches/{id}** - For match editing (with teams & event)
- âœ… **GET /api/admin/news/{id}** - For news editing (with author)
- âœ… **GET /api/admin/users/{id}** - For user editing (with roles)

### **âœ… 2. ENHANCED EVENT DELETION:**

The 422 error for event deletion is actually correct behavior (safety feature), but I've enhanced it:

#### **Event Deletion Options:**
- **Normal Delete**: Prevents deletion if matches exist (current behavior)
- **Force Delete**: New option to delete event and cascade delete matches
- **Alternative Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/admin/events/{id}/force` for forced deletion

#### **Enhanced Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Cannot delete event 'Community Cup #1' because it has 2 associated matches. Delete matches first or use force delete.",
  "can_force_delete": true,
  "match_count": 2
}
```

## ðŸš€ **USAGE EXAMPLES:**

### **Admin Event Editing:**
```bash
# Get event for editing (NOW WORKS)
curl -X GET https://staging.mrvl.net/api/admin/events/4 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Expected Response:
{
  "data": {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Community Cup #1",
    "type": "Community",
    "status": "completed",
    ...
  },
  "success": true
}
```

### **Force Delete Event:**
```bash
# Option 1: Force delete via query parameter
curl -X DELETE "https://staging.mrvl.net/api/admin/events/4?force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Option 2: Force delete via dedicated endpoint
curl -X DELETE https://staging.mrvl.net/api/admin/events/4/force \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Expected Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Event 'Community Cup #1' and 2 associated matches deleted successfully"
}
```
