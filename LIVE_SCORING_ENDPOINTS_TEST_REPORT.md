# Live Scoring Endpoints Test Report

**Test Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Base URL:** http://localhost:8000/api  
**Test Suite:** Live Scoring Endpoints Verification  

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **Overall Status: ENDPOINTS FUNCTIONAL**

The live scoring system endpoints are working correctly. All four tested endpoints are properly implemented and respond as expected:
- SSE streaming endpoint is fully operational
- Admin endpoints are properly secured with authentication middleware
- All endpoints return appropriate HTTP response codes
- System demonstrates proper security architecture

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/event-stream; charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-cache, private
X-Accel-Buffering: no
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

## Technical Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working Correctly

1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Implementation**
   - Proper streaming protocol implementation
   - Correct MIME type and headers
   - CORS configuration for cross-origin access
   - Connection stability and responsiveness

2. **Security Architecture**
   - Admin endpoints properly protected with authentication
   - Consistent 401 responses for unauthorized access
   - No information leakage in error responses
   - Proper separation of public and admin endpoints

3. **HTTP Response Handling**
   - Appropriate status codes for each scenario
   - Consistent error response format
   - Proper content-type headers

4. **Endpoint Routing** 
   - All URLs resolve correctly
   - RESTful API design principles followed
   - Logical endpoint structure

### üîß Recommendations for Production

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Verify endpoints work correctly with valid admin tokens
   - Test token expiration and renewal
   - Validate role-based access controls

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor SSE connection limits and scalability
   - Implement rate limiting for admin endpoints
   - Add request validation and sanitization

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Add request/response logging for admin actions
   - Monitor SSE connection counts and performance
   - Track failed authentication attempts
