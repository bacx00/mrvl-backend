// Summary
echo "\nSUMMARY:\n";
echo "- Voting system: Database schema updated with vote_key for duplicate prevention\n";
echo "- Mentions system: Backend processing working, frontend regex patterns fixed\n";
echo "- Date formatting: Consistent utility functions imported in ForumsPage\n";
echo "- Database: All critical forum tables and relationships verified\n";
echo "\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n";
echo "1. Test the voting system on the frontend to ensure 409 errors are resolved\n";
echo "2. Verify mentions are properly clickable in forum threads and posts\n";
echo "3. Check date display consistency across forum and news components\n";
echo "4. Consider adding more test users/teams/players for mention testing\n";
