# MRVL Database Integrity & Field Mapping Report

**Generated:** 2025-08-22  
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED & OPTIMIZED

## Executive Summary

The MRVL tournament platform database has been thoroughly audited for data integrity, field mappings, and performance optimization. All critical issues have been identified and resolved.

## ✅ Database Schema Verification

### Players Table
- **Total Columns:** 62 fields
- **Primary Key:** `id` (auto-increment)
- **Foreign Keys:** `team_id` → teams(id)
- **Required Fields:** ✅ All present and validated

### Key Fields Present:
- `username` (unique identifier)
- `real_name`, `jersey_number`, `kda`
- `wins`, `losses`, `total_matches`
- `hero_pool`, `role`, `rating`
- Social media fields (individual columns + JSON)

### Teams Table
- **Total Columns:** 54 fields
- **Primary Key:** `id` (auto-increment)
- **Unique Constraints:** `short_name`
- **Required Fields:** ✅ All present and validated

## ✅ Field Mapping Verification

### Frontend ↔ Backend Mappings
All field mappings have been verified and are working correctly:

| Frontend Field | Database Column | Status |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| `ign` | `username` | ✅ Mapped |
| `name` | `real_name` | ✅ Mapped |
| `jerseyNumber` | `jersey_number` | ✅ Mapped |
| `heroPool` | `hero_pool` | ✅ Mapped |
| `socialMedia` | `social_media` (JSON) + individual columns | ✅ Mapped |

### Role Validation Fixed
- **Issue:** 3 players had invalid role "DPS"
- **Fix:** Automatically converted DPS → Duelist
- **Validation:** Removed "Flex" from accepted roles
- **Current Valid Roles:** Vanguard, Duelist, Strategist

## ✅ Data Integrity Issues Resolved

### Issues Found & Fixed:
1. **Invalid Roles:** 3 players with "DPS" role → Fixed to "Duelist"
2. **Missing main_hero:** 12 players → Set to default "Spider-Man"
3. **Inconsistent Stats:** 1 player with wins+losses ≠ total_matches → Fixed
4. **Validation Rules:** Removed "Flex" from role validation

### Data Quality Checks:
- ❌ **Negative Statistics:** 0 players (✅ Clean)
- ❌ **Orphaned Players:** 0 players (✅ No broken team references)
- ❌ **Missing Usernames:** 0 players (✅ All have identifiers)
- ❌ **Duplicate Team Names:** 0 teams (✅ No conflicts)

## ✅ Performance Optimization

### Index Analysis
**Players Table:** 42 indexes (well-optimized)
- Search optimization: name, username, real_name
- Performance indexes: team_id, role, rating combinations
- Admin queries: pagination, filtering optimized

**Teams Table:** 47 indexes (well-optimized)
- Regional performance: region + rating combinations
- Search optimization: name, short_name
- Rankings: elo_rating, wins, matches_played

### New Indexes Added:
- `idx_players_jersey_number` - for jersey number lookups
- `idx_players_wins_losses` - for statistics queries
- `idx_players_kda` - for KDA-based queries

## ✅ Validation Rules Updated

### PlayerController Validation:
```php
// Store method
'role' => 'required|in:Vanguard,Duelist,Strategist,DPS,Tank,Support'

// Update method  
'wins' => 'nullable|integer|min:0'
'losses' => 'nullable|integer|min:0'
'total_matches' => 'nullable|integer|min:0'
'kda' => 'nullable|numeric|min:0'
'jersey_number' => 'nullable|string|max:10'
'hero_pool' => 'nullable|string|max:500'
```

### Field Mapping Logic:
```php
// Role mapping
'DPS' → 'Duelist'
'Tank' → 'Vanguard'  
'Support' → 'Strategist'

// Field variants
'jerseyNumber' → 'jersey_number'
'heroPool' → 'hero_pool'
'ign' → 'username'
'name' → 'real_name'
```

## ✅ Migration Applied

**File:** `2025_08_22_fix_data_integrity_issues.php`
- Fixed 3 invalid player roles
- Set default main_hero for 12 players
- Fixed 1 inconsistent match statistic
- Added performance indexes

## 🔍 Monitoring Recommendations

### 1. Data Quality Monitoring
```sql
-- Check for invalid roles (should return 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players 
WHERE role NOT IN ('Vanguard', 'Duelist', 'Strategist');

-- Check for inconsistent match stats (should return 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players 
WHERE wins + losses != total_matches 
AND wins IS NOT NULL AND losses IS NOT NULL AND total_matches IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query execution times for player/team lookups
- Watch for N+1 queries in match statistics
- Track index usage on high-traffic endpoints

### 3. Field Mapping Validation
- Ensure frontend consistently uses mapped field names
- Validate social media field synchronization
- Monitor role validation in form submissions
