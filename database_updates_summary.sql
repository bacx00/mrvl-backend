FROM teams t
LEFT JOIN players p ON t.id = p.team_id
WHERE t.id IN (1,2,4,17,19)
GROUP BY t.id, t.name

-- =================================================================
-- ROLLBACK QUERIES (USE ONLY IF NEEDED)
-- =================================================================

-- Note: The following are rollback queries in case the updates need to be reversed
-- They are commented out for safety and should only be used if absolutely necessary

/*
-- Rollback team updates (restore to previous state)
UPDATE teams SET 
    country = 'United States', 
    coach = NULL, 
    region = 'Americas', 
    earnings = 0 
WHERE id IN (1,2,4,17,19);

-- Note: Player rollbacks would be complex as placeholder data was replaced
-- A database backup restore would be recommended for complete rollback
