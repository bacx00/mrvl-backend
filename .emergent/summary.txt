The previous AI engineer worked on a Laravel 11 Marvel Rivals Esports Backend, progressing from 95% completion to fixing critical issues. Initially, the task was to resolve conflicting routes causing a 500 error on match updates. However, the  file became corrupted with HTML, breaking all API endpoints. The AI successfully restored the file via  and re-implemented comprehensive match update, retrieval, and live-scoring endpoints, ensuring map data persistence, hero composition retention, and accurate country data for players. This brought the backend to a 100% complete success state for core match management. Subsequently, the focus shifted to adding advanced analytics, leaderboards, and search functionalities. The immediate challenge is creating reliable test data for these new analytics endpoints, as previous attempts to create or use existing matches for testing failed due to data structure mismatches or persistence issues. The  file has suffered multiple corruptions during this process, requiring repeated restoration from git. The current state involves attempting to create a minimal, valid test match to unblock analytics testing.

The goal is to develop a Laravel 11 Marvel Rivals Esports Backend, serving as an HLTV.org equivalent. The application manages user authentication (multi-role), Marvel Heroes data (22 heroes grouped by role), news, forums (with 6 default categories), and an admin dashboard with real-time stats. The core problem initially was a 500 error in match update endpoints due to route conflicts. This escalated to a critical backend issue where the entire  file was corrupted, causing all API endpoints to fail. Key frontend-backend synchronization issues were identified, including loss of map data, hero compositions, and missing player country data after admin updates. The project required robust match management, including creating, updating, pausing, and completing matches, live scoring with hero and player stats, and accurate country flag display. Subsequent requirements emerged for advanced backend analytics, such as K/D ratios, player performance metrics, tournament leaderboards, and enhanced match search/filtering. The system needs to ensure seamless data flow and persistence across all operations to support a professional esports platform.

<code_architecture>



-   **/app/backend/routes/api.php**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: This is the central file for the backend's API definitions. It encompasses all functionality from authentication to complex match management and analytics. Its integrity is critical for the application's functionality.
    -   **Summary of changes**: This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the trajectory.
        -   **Initial State**: Contained basic authentication, heroes, news, forum, and admin dashboard routes, but had conflicting  routes causing 500 errors.
        -   **Post-Corruption (Chat 23-45)**: The file was completely corrupted with HTML content. It was restored via .
        -   **Enhanced Match Endpoints (Chat 46-47)**:
            -   : Modified to accept and store complete match data, including  (JSON) and  (JSON) for compositions, player stats, scores, and status.
            -   : Added to retrieve the full match data, parsing JSON fields and including comprehensive player details with country fallbacks.
        -   **Hero Image & Game Data Fixes (Chat 59)**:
            -   : Updated to correctly serve  hero images, with fallback logic.
            -   : The public match endpoint was updated to use stored  instead of static data, including a default structure if  is null.
            -    and : New endpoints added to provide static Marvel Rivals game maps and modes data.
            -   : New endpoint for granular real-time updates of player stats and team scores within a map.
        -   **Advanced Analytics & Debug Endpoints (Chat 82-88)**:
            -   , , , , : Added for comprehensive analytics features (K/D, damage/healing per minute, efficiency, hero usage, player impact, search/filter, bulk updates).
            -   , , , : Added for debugging, creating test data, checking database health, and listing admin matches.
            -   , : Comprehensive and simplified test match creation endpoints to populate the database with rich data for analytics testing.
            -   , : Minimal test endpoints added at the very end to simplify testing of analytics.

-   **Database Schema**:
    -    table: Columns , ,  (VARCHAR(5)) were added to store player country information, with default 'US'.
    -    table:  and  columns (JSON type) are used to store detailed match map information, including team compositions, hero selections, and player statistics (eliminations, deaths, assists, damage, healing, damageBlocked).

<pending_tasks>
-   Successfully create a new, comprehensive test match with complete Marvel Rivals data via a backend endpoint.
-   Validate that the newly created test match's data is correctly persisted and can be retrieved by the advanced analytics endpoints (e.g., ).
-   Begin frontend integration, particularly implementing the data transformation layer and fixing state management issues in .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was grappling with persistent  file corruption and the inability to reliably create a test match with rich data needed to test newly implemented advanced analytics endpoints. The previous attempt to create a complete Marvel Rivals match via  failed due to an  error related to the  column. To circumvent this, the AI proposed and attempted to implement a simplified test match creation endpoint (). However, adding this new route also resulted in a  in . The current action taken by the AI was to  to revert to a known clean state, and then re-add *minimal* test endpoints ( for match creation and  for analytics) to attempt to establish a working foundation for testing the backend's new capabilities. The last message from the user indicates that even after the , the  command for  still reports errors, suggesting the  file itself, or the git version, might also be problematic, or the restoration process introduced new issues.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the syntax of  again after the , and if clean, proceed to create a test match using the newly added minimal  endpoint.
