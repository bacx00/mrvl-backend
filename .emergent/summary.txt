The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a Laravel 11 backend for a Marvel Rivals esports platform, aiming to replicate HLTV.org's functionality. Initial challenges involved resolving server errors (, ) for core API endpoints. The engineer then significantly expanded the backend to support Marvel Rivals' specific game mechanics, including 6v6 teams, game roles, enhanced statistics, and various match formats, alongside a suite of community features. A major phase involved debugging deployment issues where locally implemented features failed on the staging server and resolving authentication problems (, invalid tokens). Subsequent work focused on achieving real-time synchronization for live matches and ensuring state persistence across navigation, which involved adding missing database columns and refactoring code to align with the updated schema. Although significant progress was made, some subtle data inconsistencies and a critical match creation validation error remain.

The primary objective is to build a Laravel 11 backend for a Marvel Rivals esports platform, functioning as an HLTV.org equivalent. This encompasses comprehensive match management (creation, live scoring, granular player/hero statistics like eliminations, deaths, assists, damage, healing, damage blocked, ultimate usage, objective time), advanced player analytics, tournament leaderboards, match search/filtering, and multi-role user authentication (Admin, Moderator, User). The platform requires integration of detailed Marvel Heroes data, news, forums, and an admin dashboard with real-time statistics. Key expansions included full 6v6 match support, Marvel Rivals-specific hero roles (Vanguard, Duelist, Strategist), multi-game series formats (BO1, BO3, BO5, BO7), and advanced community features such as news moderation, community rankings, voting systems, user profile pictures, tournament bracket management, team management (roster, transfers), predictions/betting, VOD systems, fantasy leagues, and an achievement system. Critical current requirements involve ensuring real-time data synchronization persists across user navigation and that match creation uses valid team and event data, avoiding generic placeholders.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Laravel 11 & PHP**: Core backend framework.
-   **MySQL**: Relational database for all application data.
-   **Laravel Sanctum**: API authentication with bearer tokens.
-   **RESTful API Endpoints**: Standard for communication.
-   **Database Schema Management**: Adding and altering table columns.
-   **Route & Cache Management**: Laravel optimizations and debugging.
-   **Real-time Synchronization**: Implementing live updates and persistence.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: This is the primary file for the backend API. It has been extensively modified to define numerous endpoints for game data, match management (including 6v6 support, new stats, BOx formats), analytics, and role-based access control. Recently, a full suite of community features (Team Management, Tournament Brackets, Predictions, VODs, Fantasy Leagues, Achievements) was added. Crucially, endpoints for real-time live match synchronization (, , , , , , and persistent state management like , ) were implemented and debugged. A  route was added to resolve authentication redirects, and a function redeclaration error () was fixed by using inline closures.
-   ****: This file contains the evolving API documentation, updated to reflect new endpoints and data structures, including details on 6v6 format, Marvel Rivals roles, and various match series.
-   ****: A newly created, comprehensive documentation file providing a full API reference, authentication details, and examples for all 10 HLTV.org equivalent features, intended for the frontend team.
-   ****: This newly created file provides SQL commands and instructions for manually updating the  table in the MySQL database to include columns essential for live match state persistence, such as , , , , , , , , , and .
-   **Database Schema ()**: The  table has been successfully updated with new columns for live match data persistence. The  table's  ENUM now correctly includes Marvel Rivals-specific roles (, , , , ).

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on addressing data quality and validation issues during match creation. The specific problem encountered was an  error, which was subsequently resolved by the user's direct database schema update, adding missing columns like , , , , , , , and  to the  table. This allowed the , , , and  endpoints to function correctly and persist data. The system now successfully updates 39 heroes, 12 maps, and 6 modes with 2025 official data. Key real-time synchronization features (score, hero, and map changes, live status, timer updates, and persistence across navigation) are confirmed working, and the full suite of advanced features (VODs, Fantasy, Achievements, Predictions) is operational. However, a  error for  persists, and the most immediate issue is  when attempting to create a new match with . This specific error prevents further testing of the real team name display functionality.
