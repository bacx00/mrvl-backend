The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing a Laravel 11 Marvel Rivals esports backend. Initial efforts involved battling  corruption and populating the database with core entities (events, teams, players, matches) via  due to API issues and schema mismatches. A significant challenge was ensuring Laravel route caching and service restarts correctly reflected code changes on the staging environment. The engineer successfully built and deployed a comprehensive scoreboards, player analytics, hero usage, and leaderboard system. However, the trajectory concludes with persistent  and  for newly added  routes for live viewer and aggregated match statistics, indicating further debugging is needed related to database schema compatibility and route implementation for these specific endpoints. The core game data, scoreboards, and GET analytics/leaderboard endpoints are functional.

The goal is to develop a Laravel 11 backend for a Marvel Rivals esports platform, aiming for features akin to HLTV.org. Core requirements include user authentication (multi-role), comprehensive Marvel Heroes data, news, forums, and an admin dashboard with real-time statistics. Initial challenges involved resolving  corruption and  on match updates. The platform expanded to require robust match management (create, update, pause, complete), live scoring with granular hero/player statistics (eliminations, deaths, assists, damage, healing, damage blocked), accurate country data, advanced analytics (K/D, performance, hero usage), tournament leaderboards, and match search/filtering. The system necessitates seamless data flow for a professional esports experience. Currently, all game data (heroes, maps, modes) is available, and core entities like events (ID 21), teams (Sentinels ID 87, T1 Marvel ID 86, test1 ID 83, test2 ID 84), and players (IDs 169-180 for test teams; IDs 183-194 for Sentinels/T1) are populated. A championship match (ID 99) and a test match (ID 97) are established in the database, with Match 97 specifically targeted for frontend integration.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Laravel 11 & PHP:** Primary backend framework for API development.
-   **MySQL:** Relational database for storing all application data.
-   **Laravel Sanctum:** Handles API authentication with bearer tokens.
-   **RESTful API Endpoints:** For data retrieval and manipulation.
-   **JSON Data Storage:** Utilized for flexible data structures in database columns (e.g., , ).
-   **Laravel Artisan Tinker:** Command-line tool for direct database interaction and debugging.
-   **Schema Debugging:** Process of identifying and resolving database column mismatches and constraints.
-   **Route Caching:** Laravel's mechanism for optimizing route loading, often requiring  and service restarts.

-   ****:
    *   **Summary of importance**: This file is critical as it defines all API routes, controlling access to data and functionality. Its stability and correct configuration are paramount for the application's functionality.
    *   **Summary of changes**: This file has been a consistent point of failure due to corruption and syntax errors.
        *   Initially, it was prone to corruption and  errors due to various issues, often requiring .
        *   It was updated to include comprehensive game data endpoints:
            *   : Returns a basic list of 5 heroes.
            *   : Returns the full roster of 29 heroes with roles/types.
            *   : Returns a list of 10 official maps.
            *   : Returns a list of 4 game modes.
        *   Significant additions were made to implement scoreboards, analytics, and live match management:
            *   : Fetches detailed live scoreboard data for a given match, including team and player rosters, and potentially statistics.
            *   : Endpoint to update individual player statistics (kills, deaths, assists, damage, healing, damage blocked) during a live match.
            *   : Designed for bulk updates of player statistics.
            *   : Endpoint for authorized users to update match status.
            *   : Retrieves individual player performance statistics and match history. This route experienced  and was simplified to return basic player info and empty stats for stability.
            *   : Provides aggregated statistics on hero pick rates, total kills/deaths, and average damage. This route also experienced  and was simplified, currently returning empty data.
            *   : Returns a list of player rankings based on various metrics.
            *   : Returns a list of team rankings.
            *   : Designed to update live viewer counts from streaming platforms. Currently returning .
            *   : Retrieves real-time viewer data, including current count, peak viewers, and milestones. This route works, returning empty viewer data initially.
            *   : Intended to trigger post-match aggregation of player and team statistics for profiles. Currently returning .
            *   : To finalize a match, record the winner, final score, duration, and MVP. Currently returning .
        *   Repeated fixes for syntax errors (e.g., unmatched  and duplicate  imports) were performed in this file.

-   **Database Schema ()**:
    *   ** table**: Stores event details (, , , , , , , ). Event ID 21 and 20 are present.
    *   ** table**: Stores team information (uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ). Teams 83 (test1), 84 (test2), 86 (T1 Marvel), and 87 (Sentinels Marvel Esports) are populated.
    *   ** table**: Stores player data (uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ). Players 169-180 (for test1/test2) and 183-194 (for Sentinels/T1) are populated.
    *   ** table**: Stores match details (uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , , , , , , , ,  (JSON), , , ,  (JSON),  (JSON)). Matches 97 (upcoming) and 99 (live) are populated.
    *   ** (pivot table)**: Expected to store player-specific statistics per match (kills, deaths, assists, damage, healing, damage_blocked, hero_played). This table is the target for  and analytics.

<pending_tasks>
-   Further robust implementation of  to correctly update live viewer counts and related analytics.
-   Debugging and fixing the  on  to ensure player and team profiles are updated post-match.
-   Debugging and fixing the  endpoint which currently returns .
-   Ensuring  works without errors after all new routes are integrated and stable.
-   Populating or simulating data for player/hero statistics to enable non-empty responses from analytics endpoints ( and ).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in debugging the newly implemented API endpoints for advanced match metrics and viewer management. Specifically, the focus was on resolving  for  and , and a  error for .

The preceding work successfully established:
1.  **Core Game Data Endpoints**: , , ,  are all functional and return correct JSON.
2.  **Match Scoreboards**: The  endpoint is fully functional, confirmed to work for Match ID 97 (test1 vs test2) and correctly displays player rosters for both teams.
3.  **Player Analytics (GET)**: The  endpoint is now working for players like ID 169 and 176, returning player info and an  object, though  and ,  etc. are currently zero as no match player statistics have been successfully recorded yet.
4.  **Hero Usage Analytics (GET)**: The  endpoint is functional, but currently returns empty  and  with a message No match data available yet, indicating data needs to be fed.
5.  **Leaderboards**:  and  are fully functional.
6.  **Viewer Analytics (GET)**:  is functional but shows zero viewers/peak viewers, as no viewer data has been successfully posted.

The  file was updated to include all these new endpoints, and several syntax errors (duplicate  import, unmatched ) were identified and fixed during this debugging phase. The last message indicates a persistent  when trying to  data to the  endpoint, and the AI engineer is about to make the route more robust to handle potential database column issues.
