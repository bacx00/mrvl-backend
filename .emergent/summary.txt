The previous AI engineer navigated a challenging trajectory involving a Laravel 11 Marvel Rivals Esports Backend. The core difficulty stemmed from persistent corruption of the  file, which frequently broke all API endpoints. The AI repeatedly used  and manual  edits to fix syntax errors and re-integrate routes. A significant portion of the work involved debugging database schema mismatches ( for teams, , ,  for players, ,  for matches) by using  for direct data insertion and schema inspection, bypassing problematic API routes. While core game data endpoints (, , ) are now stable and populated, and fundamental entities like events, teams, players (with hero assignments), and a championship match are created in the database, advanced features like comprehensive live scoring, analytics calculations, and leaderboards remain to be fully implemented and tested through their respective API routes. The AI engineer successfully established the foundational data layer despite numerous integration and schema hurdles.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build a Laravel 11 backend for a Marvel Rivals esports platform, akin to HLTV.org. Initial requirements included user authentication (multi-role), Marvel Heroes data (22 heroes by role), news, forums, and an admin dashboard with real-time stats. A critical problem involved a 500 error on match updates due to route conflicts, escalating to  corruption. Key needs expanded to robust match management (create, update, pause, complete), live scoring with hero/player stats, accurate country data, advanced analytics (K/D, performance, hero usage), tournament leaderboards, and match search/filtering. The system requires seamless data flow and persistence for a professional esports platform. The current state has all game data (heroes, maps, modes) readily available, and core entities like events, teams, players with assigned heroes, and a match are established in the database, setting the stage for developing comprehensive scoreboards and analytics.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Laravel 11 & PHP:** Primary backend framework.
-   **MySQL:** Database for all application data.
-   **Laravel Sanctum:** For multi-role API authentication.
-   **API Endpoints:** RESTful endpoints for data management.
-   **JSON Data Storage:** Storing complex data (e.g., ) in JSON columns.
-   **Route Management:** Defining and resolving API routes ().
-   **Laravel Artisan Tinker:** Command-line tool for direct database interaction and debugging.
-   **Schema Debugging:** Identifying and adapting to existing database column constraints and ENUM types.

-   ****:
    *   **Summary of importance**: This is the central file for API route definitions. Its integrity is crucial for backend functionality.
    *   **Summary of changes**: This file experienced repeated corruption with raw PHP output and  errors due to various issues (e.g., double  prefixes, syntax errors after concatenation, removal of custom routes by ).
        *   Initial state was corrupted, then restored via .
        *   New comprehensive routes from  were attempted to be integrated, leading to syntax errors due to duplicate  tags and unexpected characters ().
        *   The  prefix was removed from internal route definitions (e.g.,  instead of ) via  to resolve  issues.
        *   The file was frequently d to a clean state.
        *   Most recently, specific functional endpoints for game data were manually re-added to :
            *   : Provides a basic list of 5 Marvel Rivals heroes (Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Thor, Luna Snow, Punisher).
            *   : Provides a list of 10 official Marvel Rivals maps with their modes.
            *   : Provides the complete roster of 29 Marvel Rivals heroes with roles (Vanguard, Duelist, Strategist) and types (Tank, DPS, Support).
            *   : Provides a list of 4 game modes with descriptions.
            *   : A simplified admin endpoint to create a match with pre-defined Marvel Rivals data (teams 87 and 86, event 21) and an initial map composition.

-   **Database Schema ()**:
    *   ** table**: Confirmed to have columns like , , , , , , , . Event ID 21 (Marvel Rivals World Championship 2025) was created.
    *   ** table**: Initially caused . It has uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . Teams (Sentinels Marvel Esports - ID 87, T1 Marvel - ID 86) were successfully created via , bypassing the API issue and adhering to actual schema.
    *   ** table**: Caused , then , then . It has uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , ,  (ENUM: 'Duelist','Tank','Support','Flex','Sub'), , , , , , , , , , , , , , . 12 players (6 for Sentinels, 6 for T1) were successfully created via  with unique usernames, roles and main heroes, filling all required fields.

A championship match (ID 99) was successfully created via  with the status set to 'upcoming' and then manually updated to 'live'.

-   Complete the scoreboards system by integrating player statistics (eliminations, deaths, assists, damage, healing) into match data.
-   Implement and test real-time match updates for player statistics.
-   Develop and validate analytics endpoints for K/D ratios, performance metrics, and hero usage.
-   Build tournament leaderboards based on collected player and match data.
-   Address and fix the authentication-required API routes that are currently failing (e.g.,  and  via ).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on ensuring the foundational data for the Marvel Rivals esports platform was correctly populated in the database, especially after persistent issues with  corruption and API calls failing due to missing or incorrect database schema fields.

The  file was restored using  and then essential game data endpoints were meticulously re-added. These now include  (basic list),  (complete 29 hero roster),  (10 official maps), and  (4 game modes). All these public endpoints are confirmed working and return correct JSON data.

The main work was then concentrated on populating the database with core entities required for a complete esports simulation:
1.  **Event Creation**: A Marvel Rivals World Championship 2025 event was successfully created (ID 21).
2.  **Team Creation**: Sentinels Marvel Esports (ID 87) and T1 Marvel (ID 86) teams were successfully created via  after multiple API failures related to the  column.
3.  **Player Creation**: 12 professional players (6 for Sentinels, 6 for T1 Marvel) were meticulously created via . This involved resolving multiple schema errors for missing , , and  fields, and  unique constraint violations by providing unique values and including all required columns. Each player now has a name, username, team association, role (Tank, Duelist, Support, Flex), region, country, age, and a primary Marvel hero assigned.
4.  **Match Creation**: A championship match (ID 99) was successfully created via  for Sentinels vs T1 Marvel, setting its status to 'upcoming' and then 'live'.

The system now has a robust dataset of game information, organized teams, and a fully populated roster of players with their main Marvel heroes, all linked to a live match. The next logical step is to build out the functionality for live scoring and performance analytics using this rich data.
