# Testing Protocol

## Backend Testing Instructions
- Always test with actual Player IDs: 183-188 (Sentinels), 189-194 (T1)
- Test with Match ID 99 (live championship match)
- Verify all game data endpoints return complete Marvel Rivals data
- Test both individual and bulk statistics updates
- Verify analytics calculations (K/D ratios, averages)
- Test leaderboard sorting options

## Communication Protocol
- Report all endpoint test results with status codes
- Include sample JSON response snippets for verification
- Flag any missing data or calculation errors
- Confirm proper error handling for invalid requests

## Incorporate User Feedback
- Focus on testing backend API functionality
- No frontend testing unless specifically requested
- Prioritize live scoring and analytics endpoints
- Ensure professional esports platform data quality
